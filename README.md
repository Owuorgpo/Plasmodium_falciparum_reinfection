# Plasmodium_falciparum_reinfection
This is the analysis pipeline for reinfection/recrudescence study. It is just the beginning of the analysis and different changes will be made constantly as we work towards the conclusion of the project. Somethings may be off, doing this for the first time! I will annotate the different files and reorganize them to look logical.
